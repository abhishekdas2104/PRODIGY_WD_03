🎮 Tic Tac Toe Web Application

This project is a modern and interactive Tic Tac Toe Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 💻. The goal of this project is to combine classic game logic with a clean, professional, and tech-inspired user interface, creating an engaging experience for users while demonstrating strong frontend development fundamentals.

The application allows two players to compete against each other in real time, taking turns to place their markers on a 3×3 grid ❌⭕. The game dynamically tracks user interactions, manages the game state, and checks all possible winning conditions to determine the outcome. Players aim to place three identical symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—to win the match 🏆.

A key highlight of this project is its dynamic scoreboard system 📊. The scoreboard automatically tracks and displays the number of wins for Player X, Player O, and the total number of draws. This allows users to play multiple rounds continuously while keeping an accurate record of results, enhancing competitiveness and replay value.

The user interface is designed with a modern glassmorphism style ✨, soft shadows, rounded corners, and smooth animations. A tech-themed background image combined with a 60% transparent overlay creates visual depth while ensuring excellent readability. Neon-style highlights for player symbols give the game a futuristic and professional appearance, making it visually appealing and intuitive to use.

The application is fully dynamic and responsive 📱, adapting seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Every user interaction—including hover effects, clicks, and game resets—feels smooth and responsive, improving overall usability.

JavaScript plays a central role in handling user input, updating the board state, detecting wins or draws, switching player turns, and updating the scoreboard in real time ⚙️. The project is built entirely using core web technologies without external libraries, keeping the code lightweight, fast, and easy to understand.

This Tic Tac Toe project demonstrates essential frontend concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic, and UI state management 🎯. It serves as a strong practice project for beginners and an excellent portfolio piece for showcasing clean design, structured logic, and interactive web development skills.

Overall, this application reflects how traditional games can be reimagined with modern design principles, delivering both functionality and an engaging user experience 🎉.
